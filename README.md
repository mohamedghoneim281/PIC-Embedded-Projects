# PIC-Embedded-Projects
Projects I've made during the PIC embedded course with Eng/Khaled Magdy using C language covering all basic embedded systems concepts.  


## Notes
These projects were made using MPLAP IDE and Proteus.  
The micro-controller model used in most of these is PIC16F877A.  
Most of them contain a screenshot indicating the circuit and how it works without having to download and open the proteus file.
